# SireMock

SireMock is a Scala wrapper for WireMock, which is a HTTP simulator that runs on the JVM.
The main idea of SireMock is to provide a more friendly api for Scala.

If you want to start with SireMock, first you need to add the dependency:

```scala
//only for Scala 2.12

resolvers += "gabfssilva releases" at "http://dl.bintray.com/gabfssilva/releases"

libraryDependencies += "io.github.gabfssilva" %% "siremock" % "0.0.1" % "test"
```
